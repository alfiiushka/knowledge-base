## Optimization of daily meetings

### Daily

The main thought is to waste time as little as it possible.

To not waste time:

  - I suggest to exclude phase where every team member speaks about what have been done or what's in progress - all the information about work 
can be found in Jira/ Version Control systems. 
Also, humans are not machines. We are productive one day and not productive the next. In such cases, daily meetings with nothing to say
can lead to feelings of guilt and burnout.
  - It's important not to mix daily team meeting(where participants are Back-end, Front-end, Ios, Android, QA etc) with task discussion.
   Especially if you have a big team - most of your team will lose their time on such meetings.

Example:

**Phase #1:**

  Every part of team (Back-end, Front-end, Ios, Android, QA etc) meets with lead - share the necessary information about the progress in tasks, difficulties 
  and determining what tasks will be taken on during the day.
  
**Phase #2:**

  Meeting only for leads and Project Manager - announcement of a future release / events (demonstration, meetings, communication with customers) 
  / project news / priorities / each lead talks about what tasks have been completed and what's planned to de done.
  
**Phase #3(unnecesary):**
  
  If during the meeting with Project Manager priorities have changed/ urgent tasks or questions have appeared -
  additional meetings can be arranged to adjust work plans.
